# Parking-Spot-Reservation-System

#### Parking Spot Reservation System
This is a simple C++ program for managing parking spot reservations in a parking lot. 
Users can book parking spots for their cars or unpark them if they decide to leave.
The program provides a visual representation of the parking lot, allowing users to see available spots and those already reserved.

#### Features
- Parking Reservation: Users can book parking spots by specifying the row and column where they want to park their cars.
- Parking Cancellation: Users can cancel their parking reservations, freeing up the spot for others.
- Visual Representation: The program displays a visual map of the parking lot, making it easy for users to see available and occupied spots.
- Input Validation: Input is validated to ensure that users provide valid row and column values.
- Exit Option: Users can exit the program at any time by entering '0' and confirming their choice.

#### Menu Options:
1. **Park a Car** (1): Enter the row (A-F) and column (1-10) to reserve a parking spot.
2. **Unpark a Car** (2): Enter the row (A-F) and column (1-10) to cancel a parking reservation.
